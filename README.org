* My Neovim&&Vim Configuration

** First of all , make sure that you understand every line in your vimrc when using vim 
btw this is a small (on my computer start only need 200ms,that you can't feel it) but still powerful configuration when you editing a small file , maybe it can't perform very well in a big project or a lot of files , with poor ability to jump to a file or a definition of a function . However you can polish by yourself 
P.S if who you are looking this , that's not mess code in the configuration it's chinese
** Requirements
*** must
   - nodejs
   - pynvim 
   - yarn
*** optional
   - texlive
   - Okular
   - ccls
   - gopls
   - devel
** Install
   if you first use vim or nvim , make sure network is OK,then
#+BEGIN_SRC 
   cd ~/
   chmod +x Myvim/install.sh
   ./Myvim/install.sh
#+END_SRC
   after this run vim+PlugInstall or nvim+PlugInstall
   make sure the floder coc is in your directory ~/.config/
   
   if your network is not good enough 
   you can run the commands in that shell scripts by yourself
 
** KeyBindings
   there is just a little keybindings , so you can read the vimrc for deatail 
   also , maybe try it can help you learn it better
